    <h2>This is my story!</h2>
    <section class="bio">
      <p>
        I have been a tester, a product manager, a designer, and a developer. I feel that focusing on user experience is the culminantion of all the roles that I have performed throughout the years.
      </p>

      <p>
        After graduating with a four year degree in Game Development, I tested digital battle systems in the hands of soldiers and was a PM for simulation system that tested army systems.
      </p>

      <p>
         I wanted to be more technical and creative, so I left to pursue freelance web design. I worked as a UI developer, where I designed and developed dashboards used by teachers to track student progress and identify students in need of help.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was starting to focus on UX before I took some time off to take care of my family. Specifically, I was supporting my autistic son as he underwent in home therapy 30-35 hours a week. During that time I worked with his therapists to help him be more empathic, to self-organize, and interact with his peers in a way that reinforced relationships.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am currently enrolled in a UX/UI program because as I look into reentering the workforce I want to be able to focus on creating awesome user interfaces and solving user problems.
